# IMPROVEMENTS TO LOOK FOR
- first response to Yes should work.
- saving the date in due date after calculating
- also need to save a log about saving the calltime and duration
- audio recording of each call for quality purpose testing
- need gender column to address the customer accordingly
- if reciever refuse that he is not who we are looking for then??
- fallback at the first go when it does not recognise what reciever said
